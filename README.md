BoL Tools downloader
===================


Hey! Welcome here. This is a pretty simple and easy-to-use tool, binded on BoL-Tools, which allow you to manage your scripts. Download, update, for free users, etc.

Just place it in your BoL folder, then run it.
For the first use, you will need to select your BoL exe or your tangerine dll.
(needed step to make me locate the bol folder path, and deal with anything else)
